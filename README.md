# FISH 510: Marine Organism Resilience and Epigenetics
**Graduate Seminar Course - Fall 2025**

## Course Description
This graduate seminar explores the intersection of marine organism resilience and epigenetics, examining how environmental factors influence gene expression patterns and contribute to adaptation and survival in marine ecosystems. Students will engage with current research literature, participate in discussions, and develop critical thinking skills in this rapidly evolving field.

## Course Structure
This course is organized into 10 weekly modules, each focusing on specific aspects of marine epigenetics and organism resilience. Course materials, readings, and assignments are organized by week in the repository structure below.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand fundamental principles of epigenetics in marine organisms
- Analyze how environmental stressors affect gene expression patterns
- Evaluate current research methodologies in marine epigenetics
- Critically assess literature on organism resilience mechanisms
- Communicate scientific findings through discussion and presentation
