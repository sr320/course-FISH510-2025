# Week 3: DNA Methylation in Marine Species

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:

- Understand DNA methylation mechanisms and patterns in marine organisms

- Compare methylation systems across different marine taxa

- Evaluate methods for studying DNA methylation

- Analyze the functional significance of methylation changes

## Key Topics

1.  **DNA Methylation Fundamentals**
    -   CpG methylation and non-CpG methylation
    -   DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)
    -   Demethylation processes
    -   Methylation maintenance vs. de novo methylation
2.  **Marine-Specific Patterns**
    -   Taxonomic variation in methylation systems
    -   Genome-wide methylation patterns
    -   Gene-specific methylation changes
    -   Tissue-specific methylation profiles
3.  **Methodological Approaches**
    -   Bisulfite sequencing techniques
    -   Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS)
    -   Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS)
    -   Methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme approaches

## Required Readings

-   [Gavery, M.R. & Roberts, S.B. (2017). Epigenetic considerations in aquaculture. *PeerJ*, 5, e4147.](peerj-4147.pdf)
-   [Liew, Y.J., et al. (2018). Epigenome-associated phenotypic acclimatization to ocean acidification in a reef-building coral. *Science Advances*, 4(6), eaar8028.](sciadv.aar8028.pdf)

## Discussion Questions

1.  How do DNA methylation patterns in marine organisms compare to those in terrestrial species?
2.  What challenges arise when studying methylation in non-model marine organisms?
3.  How might environmental factors specifically influence CpG methylation patterns?

## Student Presentation Topic

## Activities

-   **Methods Workshop**: As time allows - introduction to bisulfite sequencing data analysis
-   **Data Exploration**: Examine published methylation datasets
