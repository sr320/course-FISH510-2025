# Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Explain the mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications can be inherited across generations.  
- Differentiate between intergenerational and transgenerational inheritance.  
- Evaluate evidence for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) in marine taxa.  
- Critically assess experimental designs that test for TEI in controlled and natural environments.  
- Discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of TEI for marine species under environmental change.

## Key Topics
1. **Inheritance of Epigenetic Marks Across Generations**
   - Distinction between parental effects, intergenerational inheritance, and transgenerational inheritance  
   - Molecular mechanisms of TEI: DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs  
   - Germline versus somatic transmission  
   - Implications for adaptation, plasticity, and resilience  

## Required Readings
- Burggren, W. W. (2016). Epigenetic inheritance and its role in evolutionary biology: Re-evaluation and new perspectives. Biological Reviews, 91 (1), 377–411.  
- Venney CJ, Anastasiadi D, Wellenreuther M, Bernatchez L. The Evolutionary Complexities of DNA Methylation in Animals: From Plasticity to Genetic Evolution. Genome Biol Evol. 2023 Dec 1;15(12):evad216. doi: 10.1093/gbe/evad216. PMID: 38015807; PMCID: PMC10701099.  


## Optional Readings

## Discussion Questions
1. What experimental approaches are best suited to distinguish true transgenerational inheritance from parental or developmental effects?  
2. How might TEI influence the rate and direction of adaptation in rapidly changing marine environments?  
3. Are there limits to the persistence of inherited epigenetic marks? What factors determine whether they are maintained or erased?  
4. How could TEI be leveraged in aquaculture or conservation contexts?  

## Activities
- Student-led presentations on marine TEI case studies  
- Group analysis of a TEI experimental design paper  
- Debate: “TEI provides a mechanism for rapid adaptation in marine species — agree or disagree?”  
- Optional: Create a conceptual diagram illustrating pathways of environmental information flow across generations
