## Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance (TEI)

---

### Overview
Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) refers to the transmission of environmentally induced changes in gene expression or phenotype **across generations** without alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. In marine taxa, understanding TEI is critical for linking environmental stressors—such as temperature, acidification, and pollution—to population resilience and adaptive capacity.

## 1. Mechanisms of Epigenetic Inheritance

### DNA Methylation
- **Definition:** Addition of a methyl group (–CH₃) to cytosine bases, often at CpG sites.  
- **Function:** Typically represses gene expression by altering transcription factor binding or chromatin accessibility.  
- **Inheritance:**  
  - Can be transmitted through gametes if methylation marks escape reprogramming during gametogenesis or early development.  
  - Evidence in oysters, corals, and fish suggests some environmentally induced methylation states persist in offspring.

### Histone Modifications
- **Types:** Acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination of histone tails.  
- **Effect:** Regulates chromatin compaction and gene accessibility.  
- **Transmission:** While histone marks are often reset during reproduction, some may persist at specific loci, influencing early embryonic gene expression.

### Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)
- **Classes:** microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).  
- **Roles:** Post-transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, and cross-generational communication via gametes.  
- **Example:** In some fish species, sperm-derived miRNAs alter offspring gene expression and stress response.

## 2. Levels of Epigenetic Inheritance

| Level | Generations Affected | Transmission Pathway | Example |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Parental Effect** | Offspring (F1) | Through provisioning of gametes or maternal environment (no true inheritance) | Maternal nutrient status affecting larval growth |
| **Intergenerational Inheritance** | F1, possibly F2 if exposed during germ cell formation | Direct exposure of gametes or embryo | Adult oyster exposure to low pH alters methylation in gametes and offspring |
| **Transgenerational Inheritance** | F2 or F3 (depending on system) | Epigenetic marks transmitted without direct exposure | Persistent methylation changes in unexposed F2 coral larvae |

## 3. Germline vs. Somatic Transmission

- **Germline Transmission:**  
  - Involves inheritance via sperm or eggs.  
  - More likely to produce long-term, heritable effects.  
  - Example: Sperm methylation patterns altered by parental temperature in fish and maintained in embryos.  

- **Somatic Transmission:**  
  - Affects only somatic tissues (e.g., via parental provisioning or developmental conditions).  
  - Not stably inherited but may influence offspring phenotype indirectly.

## 4. Testing TEI Experimentally

### Key Design Considerations
1. **Control for Direct Exposure:**  
   - Only F2 (or F3) generations not directly exposed can confirm TEI.
2. **Cross-fostering or Reciprocal Designs:**  
   - Separate environmental vs. genetic/epigenetic effects.
3. **Multi-omics Integration:**  
   - Combine methylome, transcriptome, and phenotypic data for mechanistic insight.
4. **Natural Population Studies:**  
   - Use epigenetic signatures correlated with environmental histories across generations.

## 5. Ecological and Evolutionary Implications

- **Plasticity:** TEI can provide rapid, reversible adaptation to changing environments.  
- **Resilience:** May buffer populations against transient stress, buying time for genetic adaptation.  
- **Evolutionary Potential:** Stable transmission of advantageous epigenetic marks could contribute to long-term selection and divergence.  
- **Marine Relevance:** Many marine organisms have external fertilization and broad dispersal—TEI may mediate how populations respond to rapid environmental shifts.
