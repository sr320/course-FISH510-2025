# Week 2: Environmental Stressors and Gene Expression

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to: - Identify major environmental stressors affecting marine organisms - Understand how environmental factors influence gene expression patterns - Analyze experimental approaches for studying stress responses - Evaluate the role of epigenetics in stress adaptation

## Key Topics

1.  **Major Environmental Stressors**
    -   Temperature fluctuations
    -   Salinity changes
    -   Ocean acidification (pH changes)
    -   Hypoxia/anoxia
    -   Pollution and contaminants
2.  **Stress Response Mechanisms**
    -   Heat shock proteins
    -   Oxidative stress responses
    -   Cellular stress pathways
    -   Epigenetic regulation of stress genes
3.  **Experimental Approaches**
    -   Laboratory stress experiments
    -   Field studies and natural populations
    -   Multi-generational exposure studies
    -   Molecular techniques for measuring responses

## Discussion Questions

1.  Which environmental stressors pose the greatest challenges for marine organisms, and why?
2.  How do acute versus chronic stress exposures differ in their epigenetic effects?
3.  What are the trade-offs between plastic responses and evolutionary adaptation to environmental stress?
