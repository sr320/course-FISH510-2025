# Week 1: Introduction to Marine Epigenetics

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Define epigenetics and its key mechanisms
- Understand the unique aspects of epigenetics in marine environments
- Identify major research questions in marine epigenetics
- Participate effectively in course discussions

## Key Topics
1. **Epigenetic Mechanisms Overview**
   - DNA methylation
   - Histone modifications
   - Non-coding RNAs
   - Chromatin remodeling

2. **Marine Environmental Context**
   - Unique challenges of marine environments
   - Environmental variability and organism responses
   - Evolutionary implications

3. **Course Introduction**
   - Course structure and expectations
   - Using GitHub for course materials and discussions
   - Assessment methods and timeline

## Required Readings
- [Eirin-Lopez, J.M. & Putnam, H.M. (2019). Marine environmental epigenetics. *Annual Review of Marine Science*, 11, 335-368.](annurev-marine-010318-095114.pdf)

## Discussion Questions
1. How do marine environments present unique challenges for epigenetic regulation compared to terrestrial environments?
2. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of epigenetic versus genetic adaptation in marine organisms?
3. How might climate change affect epigenetic processes in marine ecosystems?

## Activities
- **Introduction Post**: Create a post in GitHub Discussions (**Research Connection:: Personal Research Connection**) introducing yourself and your research interests
- **Concept Mapping**: Develop a concept map connecting epigenetic mechanisms to marine environmental factors

## Additional Resources
- [Key terminology glossary](glossary.md)
- [Epigentics Explainer : YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/embed/MD3Fc0XOjWk)
- [Paper audio summary](paper-summary.mp3)

## Assessment
- Address Discussion Questions (You can do in 1 post; category "Course Discussion")
- GitHub Discussions introduction post (5% of final grade) (In "Research Connection")
- Engagement with peer posts (formative)
