# Non-coding RNAs and Regulation

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Explain the major classes of non-coding RNAs and their biogenesis pathways.
- Describe how microRNAs, lncRNAs, and piRNAs regulate gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.
- Evaluate recent studies that use RNA-seq and small RNA-seq data to identify regulatory RNAs in environmental and stress response contexts.

## Key Topics
1. **microRNAs, lncRNAs, and other regulatory RNAs**
   - miRNA biogenesis and function (Drosha–Dicer pathway, RISC complex)
   - lncRNA classification (sense, antisense, intergenic, enhancer-associated)
   - piRNAs and transposable element silencing
   - Regulatory mechanisms: mRNA degradation, translational inhibition, chromatin modification

## Discussion Questions
1. How do non-coding RNAs contribute to organismal plasticity in variable marine environments?
2. In what ways might ncRNA-based regulation serve as a form of “molecular memory” of past stress exposure?
3. What are the challenges in annotating and functionally characterizing lncRNAs and miRNAs in non-model marine organisms?
4. Could ncRNA expression serve as a biomarker for environmental monitoring in aquaculture or conservation applications?

## Activities
- Student presentations and discussion leadership  
- Whiteboarding
 

## Assessment
- Student presentation 
- Participation in discussion (formative)  
- Optional: Short reflection (1–2 paragraphs) summarizing how non-coding RNAs might influence adaptation to changing ocean conditions
