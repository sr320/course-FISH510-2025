# Week 10: Current Frontiers and Future Directions

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Identify emerging areas in marine epigenetics research
- Synthesize knowledge from across the course
- Evaluate future research opportunities and challenges
- Present independent research synthesis

## Key Topics
1. **Emerging Technologies**
   - Single-cell epigenomics
   - Long-read sequencing applications
   - CRISPR-based epigenome editing
   - Multi-omics integration approaches

2. **Current Research Frontiers**
   - Microbiome-host epigenetic interactions
   - Epigenetic responses to multiple stressors
   - Population-level epigenomic studies
   - Conservation epigenomics

3. **Future Challenges and Opportunities**
   - Climate change adaptation research
   - Aquaculture applications
   - Marine biodiversity conservation
   - Integrating epigenetics into ecosystem management

## Required Readings
- Recent review papers and perspectives (updated annually)
- Selected papers from current literature

## Student Presentations
Each student will present their research synthesis paper focusing on:
- Current state of knowledge in their chosen topic
- Critical gaps in understanding
- Future research directions
- Methodological considerations

## Final Discussion Topics
1. What are the most promising areas for future marine epigenetics research?
2. How can epigenetic knowledge be applied to conservation and management?
3. What interdisciplinary collaborations would advance the field?

## Course Reflection
- Synthesis of learning across all course topics
- Evaluation of course effectiveness
- Suggestions for future course iterations

## Assessment
- Final research synthesis presentation (20% of final grade)
- Peer evaluation of presentations (formative)
- Course reflection essay (5% of final grade)
