# 🔒 Secure Deployment Guide

## ✅ Your API Key is Safe!

The chatbot is configured with proper security measures:

### 🔐 Security Features
- **`.env` files are in `.gitignore`** - Your API keys will NEVER be pushed to GitHub
- **Environment variables** are used for all sensitive data
- **Deployment platforms** handle API keys securely
- **No hardcoded secrets** in the code

## 🚀 Safe Deployment Steps

### 1. Set Up API Key Locally (Safe)
```bash
cd chatbot
cp env_template.txt .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
```

### 2. Push to GitHub (Safe)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add FISH 510 chatbot"
git push origin main
```
**Your `.env` file is automatically ignored and won't be pushed!**

### 3. Deploy to Railway (Secure)
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Deploy your repository
4. Add environment variables in Railway dashboard:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your API key
   - `FLASK_ENV`: production

### 4. Share with Students
Railway provides a secure URL for your students!

## 🔍 How Security Works

### Local Development
```bash
chatbot/
├── .env                    # ← Your API key (NOT in git)
├── .gitignore             # ← Ignores .env files
├── env_template.txt       # ← Safe template (in git)
└── app.py                 # ← Reads from .env (no hardcoded keys)
```

### Deployment
- **Railway**: Stores API keys securely in their system
- **No secrets in code**: Everything uses environment variables
- **Automatic security**: `.gitignore` prevents accidental commits

## ✅ Verification

### Check Your Security
```bash
# This should NOT show your .env file
git status

# This should show .env is ignored
git check-ignore chatbot/.env
```

### What Gets Pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Code files
- ✅ Configuration templates
- ✅ Documentation
- ❌ API keys
- ❌ Environment files
- ❌ Database files
