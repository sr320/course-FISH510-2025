## Course Description
This graduate seminar course examines the intersection of marine organism resilience and epigenetics. Students will explore how environmental factors influence gene expression patterns in marine species and contribute to their adaptation and survival strategies. The course emphasizes critical analysis of current research literature and active participation in scientific discussions.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Conceptual Understanding**: Demonstrate comprehensive knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms in marine organisms and their role in environmental adaptation
2. **Critical Analysis**: Evaluate and critique current research methodologies and findings in marine epigenetics
3. **Scientific Communication**: Effectively communicate complex scientific concepts through oral presentations and written discussions
4. **Research Integration**: Synthesize information from multiple sources to understand current frontiers in the field
5. **Methodological Awareness**: Understand experimental approaches and analytical techniques used in marine epigenetics research
