# Overview & Positioning

| **Platform** | **Core Mission / What It Does** | **Underlying Approach / Strategy** |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Scite.ai** | Enhances how researchers discover and assess scientific literature via *Smart Citations* — not just how many times a paper is cited, but *how* (supporting, contrasting, mentioning). | Builds a large database of citation statements, classifies citation intent, integrates into workflows with dashboards, alerts, and the *Scite Assistant*. |
| **Elicit** | Automates and accelerates the literature review process — searching, summarizing, extracting data, and synthesizing findings. | Uses language models over large academic corpora (e.g., Semantic Scholar, PubMed) to retrieve, rank, extract, and summarize relevant papers for structured reviews. |
| **SciSpace** | Provides an “all-in-one” AI assistant for reading, querying, summarizing, and writing about academic papers. | Offers *Chat-with-PDF*, semantic search, paraphrasing, citation management, and AI writing tools to make papers interactive and accessible. |

### Summary

-   **Scite.ai** → Focused on **citation context** and credibility assessment.\
-   **Elicit** → Focused on **literature review automation** and structured synthesis.\
-   **SciSpace** → Focused on **interactive reading and writing support** for papers.




# Scenario-Based Suggestions & Comparisons

| **Scenario** | **Best Tool(s)** | **Rationale / Suggested Strategy** |
|---------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| You want to evaluate whether a given claim is heavily supported, contradicted, or controversial in the literature | **Scite.ai** | Scite uniquely surfaces *how* papers cite the target work (supporting / contrasting). Use it to check citation context, then explore key papers via Elicit or SciSpace. |
| You need to perform a full literature review or meta-analysis (screening, extraction, synthesis) | **Elicit** | Elicit is designed for structured literature reviews — build a dataset of papers, screen, extract variables, and synthesize results. Augment with SciSpace for deeper reading. |
| You are reading a dense paper and want to ask clarifying questions, follow-up, or understand methods | **SciSpace** | SciSpace excels at *interactive interrogation* of PDFs — ask questions, highlight text, and get real-time explanations of methods and terminology. |
| You are writing a manuscript and want help integrating citations, paraphrasing text, and ensuring consistency | **SciSpace + Elicit + Scite.ai** | Use SciSpace for writing and paraphrasing, Elicit to build literature synthesis, and Scite to verify citation integrity and avoid referencing retracted or disputed works. |
| You want to track how your own publications or other key works are being cited over time | **Scite.ai** | Scite provides citation dashboards, alerts, and classification (supporting / contrasting / mentioning), ideal for monitoring influence and credibility. |
