## Participation Expectations

### Weekly Discussion Timeline
- **Tuesday**: Initial posts due for the current week's topic
- **Thursday**: Peer responses and follow-up discussions due
- **Ongoing**: Engage with presentations and synthesis discussions

### Quality over Quantity
- Aim for meaningful contributions rather than frequent posts
- Take time to craft thoughtful responses that advance understanding
- Quality engagement and depth of analysis are valued over post count

### Topic-Focused Engagement
- Use the appropriate weekly category for topic-specific discussions
- Connect current week's content to previous weeks when relevant
- Build on peers' insights to deepen collective understanding

### Academic Standards
- Cite sources appropriately using scientific format
- Use proper scientific terminology and concepts
- Reference course readings and materials when relevant
- Maintain academic integrity in all posts

## Tips for Effective Participation

### Starting Weekly Discussions
1. **Reference the Week**: Include week number and specific topic in your title
2. **Set Scientific Context**: Provide background from assigned readings
3. **Focus Your Question**: Target specific concepts, methods, or implications
4. **Invite Analysis**: Ask questions that encourage critical thinking and comparison
5. **Include Citations**: Reference specific papers, figures, or data from readings

### Responding to Peers and Presentations
1. **Read Thoroughly**: Understand the original post and any referenced materials
2. **Add Scientific Value**: Contribute new evidence, examples, or methodological insights
3. **Ask Probing Questions**: Help deepen analysis of mechanisms, implications, or methods
4. **Be Constructive**: Offer alternative interpretations or additional evidence
5. **Connect Topics**: Link discussions to other weeks or broader marine science concepts

### Weekly Discussion Flow
- **Early Week**: Focus on understanding core concepts and mechanisms
- **Mid-Week**: Engage with peer posts and presentation materials
- **Late Week**: Synthesize insights and connect to broader course themes

### Using Scientific Communication
GitHub Discussions supports scientific formatting:
- Use `**bold**` for key terms and concepts
- Use `> quotes` for citing specific passages from papers
- Use `code blocks` for species names, gene names, or technical terms
- Include links: `[Author et al. (Year)](DOI or URL)`
- Use bullet points for listing mechanisms, species, or methods
